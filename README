NAME
    Image::Grab - Perl module to easily grab images from the 'net.

*** WARNING ***
        The tests will not succeed if you do not have an active net connection.

Behavior Changes:
    Since 0.9.5, I've added the search_url method in lieu of overloading regexp. This means that you'll have to check your scripts.

    Since 0.9.3, I've added the do_posix method and changed the behavior so that POSIX date substitution is only done if do_posix is set.
    This is because strftime appears to garble the 128th character and on in long string substitutions. I've seen this in Digital Unix,
    Linux and Solaris.

Installation:
    You must have the following modules already installed:

      Digest::MD5 2.07
      HTML::Parser 2.20
      HTML::Tree 0.51
      MIME::Base64 2.11
      URI 1.02
      libnet 1.0606
      libwww-perl 5.43

    (Earlier versions of some packages may work, but I haven't tested them.)

      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make test
      $ make install

    And that should do it. Let me know of any problems (<mah@everybody.org>)

Testing:
    [This information should be encapsulated in the tests themselves.]

    None of the tests will succeed unless you have an active 'net connection.

    Unless you have cookies for www.chron.com, the cookies.t test will be skipped. The tests rely on cookies being set in your
    ~/.netscape/cookies file. You could set these yourself by visiting the Huston Chronicle website (http://www.chron/content/comics) and
    getting an account. If you don't do this, these tests won't even run.

    If you are testing this from behind a firewall, be sure that your proxy environment variables are set correctly (e.g.
    http_proxy=http://wwwproxy:80/).

Response:
    If you care to, let me know how you are using this module. It's nice to know what different people are using this for.
