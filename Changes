	* Grab.pm: Added type method to return the mime type of the object
	  grabbed.

	* t/type.t: Added simple test for type method.
	
	* t/md5.t: Hardcoded md5 value instead of relying on backtic'ed
	  md5. (Test should no longer fail for non-Unix platforms.)

	* t/TestDaemon.pm: Added TestDaemon module to help with
          simplifing tests.  Helps tests pass even if they are done behind
	  firewalls.
